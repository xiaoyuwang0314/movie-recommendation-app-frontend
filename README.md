# Movie Recommendation Frontend

This is the frontend of the **Movie Recommendation System**, a full-stack web application that allows users to register, log in, browse movie data, rate movies, and view intelligent visualizations based on their history. It communicates with a Spring Boot backend deployed on AWS EC2, and the frontend is hosted via Vercel with HTTPS enabled via Cloudflare.

> This project is under active development. Some features are experimental or incomplete.

  > Note: While this repo provides full AWS provisioning (including NLB, CloudWatch, multi-tier setup), current deployment skips some components (like load balancer) to reduce cost.

- **Recommendation Engine**  
  Not yet implemented â€“ under planning and design.

## In Progress

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| TMDB Poster Integration | Planned | Will use `/v1/link/{id}` to get `tmdbId` and fetch movie images |
| Dark Mode Toggle | Planned | To be implemented using CSS variables in the footer |
| Genre-based Graph Visualization | Designing | Interactive network graph of movies sharing common genres |
| CI/CD and Deployment | Complete | Vercel + Cloudflare, auto-deployment via GitHub commits |

## Known Issues

- **Token Storage (localStorage)**  
  Token is currently stored in `localStorage`, which may be vulnerable to XSS. For better security, consider switching to HttpOnly cookies in production.

- **Load Balancer Skipped in Deployment**  
  NLB and is excluded in current deployment to save cost, although supported in infrastructure code.

- **Token Not Cleared on Logout**  
  After logout, the token remains in localStorage until page refresh. Needs improvement in session cleanup logic.
